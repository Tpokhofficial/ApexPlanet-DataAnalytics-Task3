Deep-Dive Analysis Report – Task 3

This task focuses on a deep-dive analysis of aggression behavior using an interactive dashboard built in Power BI.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as average aggression score, gender-wise aggression, and aggression by violent video game exposure were analyzed.

Respondents were segmented into three groups based on aggression score:
Low (≤ 2.5), Moderate (2.5–3.5), and High (> 3.5).

The analysis shows that the majority of respondents fall into the Moderate aggression segment.
Higher aggression scores are observed among respondents with higher exposure to violent video games.
Gender-based differences exist, but the variation is relatively small.

An interactive dashboard was created to explore these insights dynamically using filters.
Due to publishing limitations, dashboard views were exported as PDFs to demonstrate interactivity and findings.
